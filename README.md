# Ben's personal website

This project is the my final assignment for the Introductio to Web Development course that I took at Portland State University Website
The website is a simple multi-page website that essentially introduce myself and my background. It includes an About Me, Background page, Projects page, and a Contact Me page.

During the development, I have utilized many sources of instructions including materials from the class, documentation from Vue (https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), along with a few tutorials from YouTube listed below:

How to Use Google's Material Icons on Your Websites:

The Net Ninja (to learn about Vue-Routing):

Currently, the website does not have a backend built and the contact form will only trigger an event to show a message in console log when the form is submitted.
