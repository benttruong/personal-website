    This project is my Capstone project as part of the Undergraduate Program. The project is 2-term
    long and students will be working in groups where they work on real projects sponsored by local
    organizations. For this Project, our sponsor is Abilities At Work, which is an organization in
    Portlandâ€™s tri-county area to help adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities gain
    meaningful employment.

    They currently maintain a list of clients and a list of potential job leads. The current system
    that they have in place is to utilize spreadsheets containing information about both clients and
    job leads in order to manually match potential job leads with clients that could possibly
    fulfill the given job requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The broad goal of our project is to take these spreadsheets and create a program that can handle
    many of these tasks smoothly and efficiently and allow for employees to perform the above
    mentioned tasks with ease and accuracy. The program will allow for employees to easily and
    quickly add, edit, or remove both client and job information. It will also allow employees to
    filter and/or search the job database based on any number of specific fields. There will also be
    a matching feature that will allow employees to simply enter a client's initials and then, based
    on this client's information, display a list of potential jobs that match and align with the
    specific client.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, the project is mostly completed and it will be launched and handed over to Abilities
    At Work in a few weeks. For the time being, the github repo will remain private as it contains
    the hardcoded usernames and passwords and other security authorization information. Once the
    project is officially launched, all those files will be live and working on their own server and
    can be removed from the repo. The idea is to make the repo public so all team members can
    reference and show off their work as an experience. Stay tuned for an update when that happens!
