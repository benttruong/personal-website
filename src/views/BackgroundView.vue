  <h1 class="section-header">My background</h1>
  <p class="background-info">
    I have a background of Mechanical as my Associate Degree was in Mechanical Engineering, which I
    earned from Houston Community College and got me the current job fixing and maintaining the
    machines Intel uses to make their most advanced chips. Given the opportunity to go back to
    school, I figured I could try to obtain new skills and experiences from a different industry
    (Software) and that's why I am in a major that is in a different field than what I do. Upon
    graduating, I really hope I can find a good opportunity for me to apply the skills and
    experiences I have earned during school to work on positively impactful, interesting and
    challenging projects.
